# `@openmouse/protocol`

Transport-independent gaming mouse protocol codecs used by OpenMouse.

The package owns packet layouts, command constants, checksums, encoders,
decoders, protocol-specific value types, device catalogs, and the WebHID
drivers used by OpenMouse. Pure codec entry points do not depend on WebHID, so
browser, Node.js, and TypeScript projects can use them independently from the
optional driver layer.

```ts
import { buildFinalmouseReport } from "@openmouse/protocol/finalmouse";
import { encodeRazerRequest } from "@openmouse/protocol/razer";
import { RAZER_PRODUCTS } from "@openmouse/protocol/razer-devices";

import {
  createSupportedClient,
  SUPPORTED_HID_FILTERS,
} from "@openmouse/protocol/drivers";
```

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run check
```

The `prepare` script builds `dist` automatically when this package is installed
directly from Git. Codec sources are grouped by brand under `src/`; WebHID
drivers, discovery filters, the driver registry, and shared status types live
under `src/drivers/`. OpenMouse retains application orchestration and UI code.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for protocol boundaries, hardware
evidence requirements, local OpenMouse integration, and the pull-request
checklist.

An exported protocol means OpenMouse implements that wire format. It does not
claim every mouse from that brand works. When a catalog provides a `verified`
field, use it to distinguish hardware-tested support from USB recognition.

LunaFury LUNA33 and TYPE33 use the shared Lamzu/CompX driver and the
`@openmouse/protocol/lamzu` entry point. The owner tested LUNA33 firmware
`0.0.26.0` over cable and the 8K receiver. TYPE33 and the new bottom-button
power/DPI behavior still need hardware testing. See
[docs/lunafury-testing.md](docs/lunafury-testing.md) for packet evidence,
the verified feature list and the hardware checklist.

The Ninjutso catalog and packet layouts are derived from the JavaScript shipped
by the official NinjaForce WebHID panel. They have automated transport and
codec coverage, but are not marked as hardware-verified until tested on the
corresponding Sora V2/V3 and TEN-family devices.

AJAZZ AJ179 PRO is supported by the GearHub driver, identified by device id
1851 rather than its shared receiver PID. USB, 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth settings
have been exercised on hardware. See [docs/ajazz-aj179-pro.md](docs/ajazz-aj179-pro.md)
for transport framing, verified writes and remaining limitations. This does
not claim support for other AJAZZ models or measured high-rate Bluetooth input.

The SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 1 codec and driver are derived from the public
rivalcfg project, corroborated against libratbag and OpenRGB. The device is
write-only — only the firmware version can be read back — and no entry is
marked hardware-verified yet. See
[docs/steelseries-testing.md](docs/steelseries-testing.md).
