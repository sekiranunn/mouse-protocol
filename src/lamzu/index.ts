/**
 * Products under Lamzu's own vendor id. 0x0009 (the mouse on its cable) and
 * 0x0010 (the 8K receiver) are confirmed on hardware — see
 * docs/lamzu-inca-testing.md. Both answer the mouse on target 0x02, so neither
 * needs a `mouseTarget` override.
 *
 * The rate split shows up in the capture itself: LAMZU_POLLING_RATES encodes
 * 1000 Hz twice, 0x01 in the 125/250/500/1000 family and 0x10 in the
 * 1000/2000/4000/8000 family, and the cable answered 0x01 where the 8K
 * receiver answered 0x40. Lamzu's Aurora configurator agrees — its device
 * table gives the Inca `PollingRateWired` 125-1000 and `_8KDonglePollingRate`
 * 500-8000 — and its `DPIMax` of 30000 is already the driver default, so no
 * `maxDpi` override is needed.
 *
 * 0x000f is the 1K receiver the Inca can also ship with. It is taken from that
 * same Aurora table (`_1KDongle` 000F, `_1KDonglePollingRate` 125-1000) and
 * has NOT been exercised on hardware; the protocol is the receiver protocol
 * either way, so the risk is a wrong rate list rather than a dead device.
 *
 * The Paro Aurora (released mid-2025, PAW3950) is also entered here from that
 * table, under the same vendor id and protocol flags as the Inca
 * (`IsNewProtocol`: 1, `IsCompx`: 0, `DPIMax` 30000 — the driver default, so
 * no `maxDpi` override). Its three ids are `PIDWired` 0x0007 (125-1000),
 * `_1KDongle` 0x000d (125-1000) and `_8KDongle` 0x000e (500-8000). None of
 * them has been exercised on hardware yet — issue #167 — so a wrong rate list
 * is the failure mode, not a dead device.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: 0x000a and 0x0002, which Aurora lists as
 * `DeviceBLPID` and `Receiver4K8KBLPID` — the DFU bootloader identities the
 * mouse and dongle take while flashing firmware. They never speak this
 * protocol and must not be offered in the picker. The Paro's own bootloader
 * ids, 0x0008 (`DeviceBLPID`) and 0x0004 (`_1KDongleIDVD`), are excluded for
 * the same reason; its 8K dongle shares 0x0002 with the Inca.
